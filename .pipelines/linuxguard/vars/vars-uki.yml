# IMPORTANT! This file must be named: "vars-{{buildTarget}}.yml" where "buildTarget" corresponds with the string passed into the buildTarget parameter in '.pipelines/build-and-validate-template.yml'
# Additionally, buildTargets must follow the same naming conventions as stage id naming, this is because it is reused for uniquely identifying each buildTarget's stage. Valid names may only contain alphanumeric characters and '_'.
